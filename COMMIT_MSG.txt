feat: auth, feed, admin, map pins, and reporting improvements

Auth & users
- Add login and sign-up pages with session-based auth
- Add users table (admin/user roles); seed admin/admin, user/user
- Require login for map, report, feed; redirect to /login when not authenticated
- Sign-up with email (no SES); new users are auto-verified and can sign in immediately

Feed & reports
- Add feed of reports within 0.5 mi; poll every 30s
- Show verified/unverified labels; admins can verify reports
- Add up/down voting with individual upvote and downvote counts
- Order reports by distance (feed, nearby, and GET /reports with ?latitude=&longitude=)
- Show report date and time (optional time on form); display in feed and admin
- Show closest address for each report (reverse geocode via Nominatim, cached in DB)
- Fix feed disappearing after submit (stop clearing coords)
- Full address on hover for truncated location in feed

Admin
- Add /admin page: list reports (with address, date/time, delete) and users (role, delete)
- Admins can delete reports, delete users, and set user role (admin/user)
- DELETE /reports/<id>, GET/DELETE/PATCH /admin/users

Map & notifications
- Add red pins on map for all reports with location; click pin for popup (severity, date, address, details)
- Refresh report pins on submit, delete, and every 30s
- Browser notifications for nearby reports (no in-page colored popup)
- Play alarm sound for high/critical severity (static/audio/alarm.mp3)
- Remove "Notifications enabled" banner; remove request.wants_json (Flask compat)

Backend
- Add report_votes table; incident_reports.verified, location_address, reported_by_user_id
- Add GET /feed (POST body: lat/lon), POST /reports/<id>/vote, POST /reports/<id>/verify
- Recreate DB if corrupted; migrate new columns on existing DB
- requirements.txt: flask, flask-cors, werkzeug (boto3 removed)
